# Escape Character
# To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
#
# An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
#
# An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
# \b - It gives backspace
# \t - It gives tab

x = "I' \bam from \"bhiwandi\"."
y = "my name\tis sunil"
print(x)
print(y)
z = 12
print(type(z))
